# Pymaceuticals Observations

* Since male and female mice were close to equally represented in the study (50.4% male / 49.6% female) and similar changes in tumor volume were observed in both male and female mice given the same drug regimen, we cannot discern based on the results whether gender had a discernable affect on drug efficacy.

* Capomulin and Ramicane seem to be equally effective based on the boxplot containing final tumor volume measurements. However, since only final tumor measurements were taken into account here, the plot does not visualize the change in tumor volume over the course of the drug regimen. Further analysis is necessary to confirm which treatment produced a higher decrease in tumor volume. The boxplot does however tell us that Infubinol had an outlier when comparing the four drug treatments (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin).

* A high correlation coefficient (R-squared = 0.84) tells us there is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume. Mice with higher tumor volumes were generally heavier in weight and vice versa. The affect is easier to observe in mice because the tumors account for a higher percentage of body weight.
